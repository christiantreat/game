# Transparent Text-Based Adventure Engine - Farming Village Edition

A bottom-up, layered game engine written in **pure C** designed for complete AI transparency. This project builds a peaceful farming simulation with a village economy and social systems where all AI decision-making is fully inspectable and logged.

## Philosophy

- **Transparency First**: Every AI decision is logged with full reasoning chains
- **Bottom-Up Development**: Build foundation first, add complexity incrementally
- **Data-Driven Design**: Game content defined in external files for easy modification
- **Peaceful Focus**: Cooperative gameplay emphasizing farming, trading, and relationships
- **2D-Ready Architecture**: Game logic separated from presentation layer for future graphical upgrade
- **Pure C Implementation**: Performance-focused with manual memory management and ECS architecture

## Project Status

### âœ… Phase 1: Core Foundation (COMPLETE)

**Goal**: Establish basic data structures and game state management

**Implemented**:
- âœ… **Component System** (pure C with 10 component types)
  - Position, Health, Inventory, Currency
  - Relationship, Needs, Schedule, Occupation
  - Memory, Goal
  - Full serialization to/from JSON

- âœ… **Entity System** (Entity-Component-System architecture)
  - Entity creation and lifecycle management
  - Component attachment/removal
  - Entity queries by component type
  - Helper functions for common archetypes

- âœ… **Game State Management**
  - Time system (day/night, seasons, years)
  - Weather tracking
  - Complete JSON serialization using cJSON
  - Save/load functionality with data integrity

**Success Criteria Met**:
- âœ“ Can create entities with components
- âœ“ Can maintain game state
- âœ“ Serialization to JSON verified
- âœ“ Load from JSON with data integrity preserved
- âœ“ All tests passing (16/16)

âœ“ Can load back from JSON
âœ“ Data integrity verified
```

## Architecture

### Entity-Component-System (ECS)

Pure C implementation of ECS architecture with manual memory management and performance focus.
